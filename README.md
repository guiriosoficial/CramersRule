# Caverna :volcano:
Caverna, é um Text-Based Adventura Game (Jogo de aventura baseado em texto pra que matou as aulas até da professora mais bonitinha que tinha) bem leve (bem levinho mesmo) pra rodar até no seu PC com arquitetura em 8 bits. :skull::skull::skull:

##### ATENÇÃO
> Este jogo foi desenvolvido por dois imbecis tentando aprender a programar em Python. Nerdes no tédio de um feriado em uma sexta a noite.

##### ATENÇÃO²
> Este jogo é livre para todos públicos dispostos a se submeter a grandes bobagens.

### Sobre o jogo
Na verdade, o **"Sobre o jogo"** está la em cima, aqui é apenas como surgiu essa idéia ridícula.
Depois de nos juntarmos em uma _call_ pelo _Skype__ querendo fazer algo, mas sem saber o que, digitamos no amigo **Google**:  _"Pequenos Projetos para iniciantes em Python"_, então pegamos essa idéia tão original, e inspirado em **Bandersnatch**, **--** e **_Nossa Imaginação_**, começamos a juntar referencias de diversos filmes e criar nosso monstrinho :3.

### A Historia
Sem spoiller qui, vai ter que jogar pra descobrir :)
(E se entender algo, me explica por favor, eu ainda nao entendi nada)

### Instalação

### Como Jogar
É bem facil, segue os passos acima pra instalar e abrir o jogo ai depois disso você se vira. :)

## Sobre nós
Mussum Ipsum, cacilds vidis litro abertis. A ordem dos tratores não altera o pão duris. Atirei o pau no gatis, per gatis num morreus. Copo furadis é disculpa de bebadis, arcu quam euismod magna. Cevadis im ampola pa arma uma pindureta.

Achou mesmo que eu ia falar sobre nós?

Nec orci ornare consequat. Praesent lacinia ultrices consectetur. Sed non ipsum felis. Per aumento de cachacis, eu reclamis. Casamentiss faiz malandris se pirulitá. Não sou faixa preta cumpadi, sou preto inteiris, inteiris.

Todo mundo vê os porris que eu tomo, mas ninguém vê os tombis que eu levo! Quem num gosta di mim que vai caçá sua turmis! Pra lá , depois divoltis porris, paradis. Sapien in monti palavris qui num significa nadis i pareci latim. Quem num gosta di mé, boa gentis num é. Quem manda na minha terra sou euzis!

Achou errado, otário!
